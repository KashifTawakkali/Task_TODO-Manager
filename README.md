### Custom Hook: useTasks

The `useTasks` hook provides the following functionality:

- Task management (add, toggle completion, delete)
- Category filtering
- Search functionality
- Sorting options
- Local storage persistence

### Context API

The app uses two context providers:

- `TaskContext` - For sharing task state across components
- `ThemeContext` - For managing dark/light mode preference

### Component Structure

- **TaskForm** - For adding new tasks with title, category, due date, and priority
- **TaskList** - Displays the list of tasks
- **TaskItem** - Individual task component with visual indicators
- **CategoryFilter** - For filtering tasks by category
- **SearchBar** - For searching tasks by title
- **SortOptions** - For sorting tasks by different criteria
- **ThemeToggle** - For toggling between dark and light mode
